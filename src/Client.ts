// The Client is one distinct actual connection
// The Client vs Player distinction is important
//      A "Player" is in a Game
//      A Client may have an associated player (or not)
//      A Player may be a robot / AI and have no associated client
// Clients have a method of sending information to the user (sockets for prototype, whatever Unity uses for that)
